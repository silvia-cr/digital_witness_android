This work presents the design and development of a digital witness prototype for Android that has been tested using the Google Pixel 3 device, chosen for having the Titan M security chip, which would meet the requirements for digital witnessing. The current solution allows the storage and transmission of electronic evidence in a secure way and verifies the identity of users using biometrics.
